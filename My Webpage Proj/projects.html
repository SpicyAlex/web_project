            <h2>Project: Senior Design 1</h2>
            <h3>Fall 2021</h3>
            <img src="IMG_7872.JPG" class="sdimg">
            <p>For my senior design 1 project I collaborated with three classmates and our sponsor <a
                    href="https://altbionics.com/">Alt-Bionics.</a> Our team is currently developing a wireless solution
                to their already wired prosthesis. We will be programming a Arduino in C to send a wireless signal to
                various hardware components thst will wirelessly drive the prosthetic hand.
                This project is part 1 of 2, as the second part will partake in the Sprong of 2022. In this project, I
                serve as the Project Manager. My roles are to be the liaison between my team and sponsor, maintaning
                schedule and palnning, assist our programming lead.

            <h2>Project: Connect Severs</h2>
            <h3>Fall 2021</h3>
            <p>In this project my profeesor tasked us with creating to sevsers in Pyhton and conncting them via sockets.
                After finshing the project I gained a better understanding of Python functions.

            <h2>Project: Replicating Snake with C</h2>
            <h3>Fall 2020</h3>
            <p>In this project I collaborated with a classmate in programming an FPGA(field frogammable gate array)
                board to replicate the game we all know, "Snake".
                Although a short project; I learned the importance of clean code </p>

            <h3>Fall 2018</h3>
            <p>In this project I collaborated with other ASME members to produce a three-dimensional design of a bus
                over 6-week timeline. Also, I acquired a solidworks certification by networking within ASME(The America
                Society of Mecahnical Engineers).</p>
