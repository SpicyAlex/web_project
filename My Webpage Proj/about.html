                Outside my academic life, I'm big on exercising and maintaning a healthy lifestyle. I enjoy talking
                about the lastest tech trends with my friends.
                I have a habit of collecting hobies, and they just keep piling up.

            <h2>As a Student</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a Computer Engineering student at UTSA. I began my college career as a
                Mechanical Engineering major, but after three semesters, I realized my passion was not present. I chose
                Computer Engineering because I've had a niche for computers since I was younger. After taking a few
                programming classes within my major, I began to develop a passion for programming.
            </p>
            <p>
                My passion for programming comes from my experience as a student and my self-education outside of class.
                In my spare time, I utilized Udemy's online coursework to improve my proficiency in object-oriented
                programming, data structures, and algorithms through a variety of topical challenges.
